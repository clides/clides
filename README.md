# Daniel Guo üëã  
**Computer Science w/ AI Specialization @ University of Waterloo**  

## üîç About Me  
- Strong interest in **AI/ML systems**, with hands-on experience in Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing, Information Retrieval, Computer Vision, and MLOps
- Passionate about developing and using **open-source** tools
- Average nvim enjoyer

## üåü Open Source Contributions
**[RankLLM](https://github.com/castorini/rank_llm)** (Python toolkit for reproducible information retrieval research using rerankers):
- One of the top contributors to this toolkit
- Designed and implemented new core features such as custom prompt template config, optimized caching with HuggingFace, few-shot examples injection, vllm integration, and more
- Helped create unittests and perform regression tests to update regression scores
- Updated RankLLM implementation in other popular repos such as LangChain, rerankers, and LlamaIndex

**[Anserini](https://github.com/castorini/anserini)** (Lucene toolkit for reproducible information retrieval research)
- Created documentation for various regression tests as well as computing their scores
- Built indexes and uploaded them to HuggingFace datasets for easy retrieval

**[Pyserini](https://github.com/castorini/pyserini/)** (Python toolkit for reproducible information retrieval research with sparse and dense representations):
- Created documentation for various regression tests as well as computing their scores
- Added feature to perform sparse vector encoding with SPLADE models to the pipeline
- Integrated the [M-BEIR](https://huggingface.co/datasets/TIGER-Lab/M-BEIR) dataset and [UniIR](https://github.com/TIGER-AI-Lab/UniIR) models into the pyserini pipeline for multimodal retrieval
